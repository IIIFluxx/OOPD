1)  What does the program do?
	Takes a randomly generated number, and assigns it to a integer variable. Based on the variable, it gives the user the output respective to the randomly generated number (case statement). 
	
2)  How many methods are there?
	1
	
3)  How many lines does each method have?
	
	
4)  How many levels of control structure nesting are in main?
	3
	
5)  What does the variable usefulThing do?
	
	There is no variable usefulThing
	
6)  What is the purpose of the if statement on line 6?
	
	There is no if statement on line 6 

7)  How many control structures are there?

	One
	
8)  How difficult would it be to allow the user to specify an upper and lower bound?

	Very difficult
	
9)	How difficult were these questions to answer?
	
	Fairly difficult :I
	
(a)  how much easier would the questions be to answer based on the current formatof the code compared to the original format?

	Immensely.

(b)  Using two examples, explainwhythe current format improves the understand-ability of the code.

	Indentation, and relevancy of variables alone can make it 100x easier to even simply understand the code from a fellow programmers perspective. Comments would make it more friendly to people with inadequate coding knowledge as well.
